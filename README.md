# Bitcoin-Data-Analysis-using-Power-BI
An end-to-end data science project that analyzes historical Bitcoin prices and predicts future trends using machine learning models. The system integrates Python for data processing, SQL Server for storage, and Power BI for interactive visualizations
The project involves:

Collecting and cleaning historical Bitcoin price data.

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.

Building machine learning models (Linear Regression & Random Forest) for price prediction.

Storing predictive results in a SQL Server database.

Creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize actual vs predicted prices.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Import & clean raw Bitcoin datasets (CSV format).
✅ Predict future Bitcoin closing prices using ML models.
✅ Visualize trends, correlations, and prediction performance with Power BI.
✅ Store actual & predicted data in SQL Server for efficient querying.
✅ Export predictions as CSV for further use.
